When explaining your Spring Boot-based food management application to an interviewer, you can keep it simple and focus on key components. Here's a structure you can use:

Introduction: "My food management application is built using Spring Boot as the backend framework. The goal of this application is to help users manage food items, orders, and inventory in a restaurant or food-related business."

Key Features: "The application includes the following features:

Food Management: Allows admins to add, update, and delete food items, manage categories, and set prices.
Order Management: Users can place orders, and admins can track and manage those orders.
Inventory Tracking: The app keeps track of food item quantities and notifies when items are low on stock.
User Authentication: The application has a secure login system using JWT-based authentication for both admins and customers."
Backend Structure: "The backend is built with Spring Boot, and I used Spring Data JPA to interact with the MySQL database. The application follows a layered architecture:

Controller Layer: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
Service Layer: Contains the business logic and interacts with the repository layer.
Repository Layer: Uses Spring Data JPA to handle database operations.
The API is RESTful, and I’ve implemented CRUD operations for managing food items, orders, and inventory."

Security: "For security, I have implemented JWT-based authentication for user login. The tokens are generated upon successful login and used to authenticate subsequent API requests. Admins have different roles, granting access to specific features like adding food items or viewing orders."

Technologies Used:

Spring Boot: To build the backend API.
Spring Data JPA: For database interactions.
MySQL: As the relational database.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For authentication and authorization.
Thymeleaf (if used): For any front-end templates, although it's not a strict part of the backend.
Conclusion: "This system can be easily scaled and integrated with other tools. It’s designed to handle high-traffic scenarios in a food management business efficiently, ensuring smooth operations and a good user experience."

Business Benefits:
Save Time.
Check Multiple Restaturant Price in one time.
Better Decision-Making:


What is JWT? 
 "JWT is a special kind of token (a small piece of data) used to prove that you are who you say you are. It's like a digital pass or ID card that helps websites know you’re logged in."

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a secure way to send information between a client and a server. 
It’s like a digital ID card that proves who you are and allows you to stay logged in to a website without entering your password again and again.
How does it work?

Login: "You log in with your username and password."
Token Creation: "If your login is successful, the server creates a JWT (a pass) and sends it to your browser."
Keep the Key: "Your browser keeps this key, so you don’t need to log in again every time."
Use the Key: "Every time you ask the website for something, you send this key with your request."
Check the Key: "The website checks if the key is valid. If it is, you can continue using it. If not, you need to log in again."
Why use JWT? "It’s quick, easy, and keeps you logged in without typing your password all the time."
