What is DispatcherServlet in Spring?
The DispatcherServlet is the front controller in Spring's web MVC framework. It handles all incoming HTTP requests, processes them, and sends back appropriate responses.

Think of it as the traffic controller of a Spring MVC application:

It receives requests.
Decides which controller should handle them.
Passes the request to that controller.
Returns the response to the client.
How DispatcherServlet Works
Client Sends a Request:
A user sends an HTTP request to the web application.

DispatcherServlet Receives the Request:
All requests are directed to the DispatcherServlet (configured in the web.xml or automatically by Spring Boot).

Request Mapping:
The DispatcherServlet uses a HandlerMapping to determine which controller should handle the request.

Controller Execution:
The controller processes the request and interacts with the service and data layers as needed.

View Resolution:
Once the controller has processed the request, it returns a logical view name.
The DispatcherServlet uses a ViewResolver to determine which view (e.g., HTML, JSON) to render.

Response Sent Back:
The final response is sent back to the client.

Key Components Used by DispatcherServlet
HandlerMapping:
Maps incoming requests to the correct controller method.

Controller:
The component that contains business logic for processing requests.

ModelAndView:
Holds data (model) and the name of the view to be rendered.

ViewResolver:
Resolves the logical view name to an actual view (e.g., a .jsp or .html file).

View:
Responsible for rendering the final output.

DispatcherServlet in Spring Boot
In Spring Boot, the DispatcherServlet is automatically configured and registered. You donâ€™t need to define it explicitly as in traditional Spring applications.

For example:

java
Copy
Edit
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/students")
public class StudentController {

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public Student getStudent(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return new Student(id, "John Doe", "john.doe@example.com");
    }
}
Steps:

The DispatcherServlet receives a request, e.g., GET /students/1.
It uses HandlerMapping to route the request to StudentController.getStudent().
The method executes and returns a Student object.
The response (e.g., JSON) is sent back to the client.
Why DispatcherServlet is Important
Centralized Request Handling: All requests pass through it, ensuring consistent processing.
Flexible Configuration: Can integrate with multiple technologies (e.g., JSON, JSP, Thymeleaf).
Seamless Workflow: Ties together controllers, services, and views in a structured manner.
In summary, DispatcherServlet is the backbone of Spring MVC that simplifies the entire web request handling process.
