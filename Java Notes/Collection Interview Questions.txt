Basic Questions
What is the Java Collection Framework?

The Java Collection Framework is a set of classes and interfaces that provides data structures (e.g., lists, sets, maps) and algorithms (e.g., searching, sorting).
What are the main interfaces in the Java Collection Framework?

Collection: Root interface for List, Set, and Queue.
List: Ordered collection of elements (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList).
Set: Collection of unique elements (e.g., HashSet, TreeSet).
Queue: Collection for holding elements prior to processing (e.g., PriorityQueue).
Map: Key-value pairs (e.g., HashMap, TreeMap).
What is the difference between Collection and Collections?

Collection: An interface that is part of the Java Collection Framework.
Collections: A utility class that contains static methods for operations on collections, like sorting and searching.
What are the differences between ArrayList and LinkedList?

Feature	ArrayList	LinkedList
Data Structure	Dynamic array	Doubly linked list
Access Speed	Faster for random access	Slower for random access
Insertion/Deletion	Slower (requires shifting)	Faster (node manipulation)
What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet?

HashSet: Unordered, backed by a HashMap.
TreeSet: Sorted in natural order or by a comparator, backed by a TreeMap.
Intermediate Questions
What is the difference between HashMap and Hashtable?

HashMap:
Not synchronized.
Allows one null key and multiple null values.
Hashtable:
Synchronized.
Does not allow null keys or values.
How does HashMap work internally?

A HashMap uses an array of buckets where each bucket is a linked list (or a tree for high load factors).
The key’s hash code determines the bucket index.
If multiple keys map to the same bucket (collision), they are stored in a linked list or tree structure.
What is the difference between Comparable and Comparator?

Comparable: Used for natural ordering by implementing the compareTo() method in the object’s class.
Comparator: Used for custom ordering by implementing the compare() method in a separate class.
What is the difference between Iterator and ListIterator?

Iterator:
Supports forward traversal only.
Can be used with all collections.
ListIterator:
Supports bidirectional traversal.
Can be used only with List.
What is a fail-fast iterator?

An iterator that throws a ConcurrentModificationException if the collection is modified during iteration (e.g., ArrayList, HashMap iterators).
What is the difference between Queue and Deque?

Queue: A collection that supports FIFO (First-In-First-Out) operations.
Deque: A double-ended queue that supports insertion and removal from both ends.
What are the differences between TreeMap and HashMap?

Feature	TreeMap	HashMap
Ordering	Sorted by keys	Unordered
Performance	Slower (O(log n))	Faster (O(1) for basic ops)
Null Keys	Not allowed	Allows one null key
Advanced Questions
How does ConcurrentHashMap work?

ConcurrentHashMap divides the map into segments to allow concurrent access.
It does not lock the entire map; only specific segments are locked during updates.
What is the difference between synchronized collections and concurrent collections?

Synchronized Collections: Use locks to ensure thread safety (e.g., Collections.synchronizedList()).
Concurrent Collections: Designed for high concurrency with minimal locking (e.g., ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList).
What is the difference between LinkedHashMap and HashMap?

LinkedHashMap: Maintains insertion order.
HashMap: Does not maintain any order.
What is the purpose of WeakHashMap?

A WeakHashMap uses weak references for its keys, allowing the garbage collector to remove entries when the key is no longer referenced elsewhere.
What is the difference between IdentityHashMap and HashMap?

IdentityHashMap: Uses reference equality (==) to compare keys.
HashMap: Uses the equals() method to compare keys.
What is the NavigableMap interface?

A sub-interface of SortedMap that provides navigation methods like lowerKey(), higherKey(), floorKey(), and ceilingKey().
Scenario-Based Questions
When would you use a LinkedList over an ArrayList?

Use LinkedList when there are frequent insertions and deletions, especially in the middle of the list.
How would you remove duplicates from a List?

By converting the List to a Set (e.g., HashSet or LinkedHashSet) and then back to a List.
How do you sort a List of objects?

Use Collections.sort() with a custom Comparator or have the object implement Comparable.
How would you handle a situation where multiple threads access a HashMap?

Use ConcurrentHashMap or synchronize the HashMap using Collections.synchronizedMap().
How do you iterate over a Map?

Using forEach with Lambda (Java 8+):
java
Copy code
map.forEach((key, value) -> System.out.println(key + ": " + value));
Using an Entry Set:
java
Copy code
for (Map.Entry<K, V> entry : map.entrySet()) {
    System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());
}
