#Monolithic architecture:
Multpile components(class) are combined in sinle large app.

✔️ Advantages:
Easy to Build – All code is in one place, so it's easy to start and develop.

Simple to Test – Testing is easier because everything is in one project.

Single Deployment – You only need to deploy one application.

Less Setup – You don’t need to manage multiple services or tools.


❌ Disadvantages:
Hard to Scale – You can’t scale one part; you have to scale the whole app.

Tight Coupling – All components are linked, so one small issue can affect the whole app.

Difficult to Update – Even a small change needs full deployment again.

Big Codebase – As the app grows, the code becomes harder to manage and understand.


#MicroServices:
MicroServices basically it is divide our large application in small parts.

✔️ Advantages:
Independent Services – Each feature (like login, order, payment) is in its own service.

Scalable – You can scale only the service that needs more power.

Flexible Technology – You can use different languages or tools for different services.

Easy to Maintain – Smaller codebases are easier to understand and fix.


❌ Disadvantages:
Complex to build: Harder to design and manage in the beginning.

More communication: Services need to talk to each other through APIs.

Deployment Management – You need to manage many deployments, not just one.

Harder to Test Together – Testing multiple services working together can be tricky.
