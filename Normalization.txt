Normalization in DBMS (Simple Definition & Example)
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to remove duplicate data and avoid errors.

1. First Normal Form (1NF)

✅ Rule: Each column should have only one value (no multiple values in a single cell).

❌ Before 1NF (Problem: Multiple values in one cell)

Student_ID	Name	Subjects
1	Alice	Math, Science
2	Bob	English, History


✔ After 1NF (Fix: Separate rows for each subject)

Student_ID	Name	Subject
1	        Alice	Math
1	        Alice	Science
2	        Bob	English
2	        Bob	History


2. Second Normal Form (2NF)
✅ Rule: No column should depend on only part of a composite key.

❌ Before 2NF (Problem: Course Name depends only on Course ID, not Student ID)

Student_ID	Course_ID	Student_Name	Course_Name
1	C101	Alice	Math
2	C102	Bob	Science


✔ After 2NF (Fix: Separate Student and Course tables)

Students Table

Student_ID	Student_Name
1	Alice
2	Bob
Courses Table

Course_ID	Course_Name
C101	Math
C102	Science
Enrollment Table

Student_ID	Course_ID
1	C101
2	C102


3. Third Normal Form (3NF)
✅ Rule: No column should depend on another non-key column.

❌ Before 3NF (Problem: Department Name depends on Department ID, not Employee ID)

Employee_ID	Name	Department_ID	Department_Name
101	John	D01	HR
102	Sam	D02	IT


✔ After 3NF (Fix: Create a separate Department table)

Employees Table

Employee_ID	Name	Department_ID
101	John	D01
102	Sam	D02
Departments Table

Department_ID	Department_Name
D01	HR
D02	IT
Key Takeaways
Normalization Level	What It Does
1NF	No multiple values in one cell
2NF	No partial dependency on part of the key
3NF	No column should depend on a non-key column
