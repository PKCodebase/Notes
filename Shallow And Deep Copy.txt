🔹 Shallow Cloning (Copy):

This is Java's default cloning method using clone() from Object class.

It copies the main object only, not the objects inside it (if any).

If the object has other objects (like inside variables), they are not copied, just referenced.

So if you change the inner object in the copy, it will also change in the original.

🧪 Summary:
✅ Main object is cloned.

❌ Inner objects are not cloned (shared).

✏️ Changes in inner objects affect both original and copy.

🔹 Deep Cloning (Copy):

Java doesn’t do this automatically — you have to write code to do it.

It copies both the main object and all objects inside it (nested ones too).

So the copied object is totally independent from the original.

🧪 Summary:
✅ Main object is cloned.

✅ Inner objects are also cloned.

✏️ Changes in either the original or copy don’t affect each other.
